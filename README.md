# ShaderCraft
This project is aimed at implementing various visual effects, with some of them being inspired by UE5 code. 
The currently implemented effects include:

The project's GitHub wiki serves as a documentation resource where details and implementation notes are recorded. It primarily serves as a memo for reference purposes.
