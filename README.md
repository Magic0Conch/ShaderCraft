# ShaderCraft
This project is aimed at implementing various visual effects, with some of them being inspired by UE5 code. 
The currently implemented effects include:
1. Exponential Height Fog [![ExpontialHeightFog]()](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Magic0Conch/gallery/blogs/pictures/ExpontialHeightFog2.gif)
2. Light Shaft  [![LightShaft.mp4]()](https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=41A7953B88DE463A&resid=41A7953B88DE463A%2110604&authkey=AMtWKLLRTeVRxgU)

The project's GitHub wiki serves as a documentation resource where details and implementation notes are recorded. It primarily serves as a memo for reference purposes.
